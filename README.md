# API Integration with OpenAI

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `api_integration.ipynb` which demonstrates the integration of OpenAI's API using Python. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to effectively use OpenAI's API for prompt engineering.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following key topics:
- **Installation**: Instructions on how to install the OpenAI library.
- **API Key Integration**: Steps to integrate the OpenAI API key for authenticating API requests.
- **Function Definitions**: Multiple functions are defined for interacting with the API, including sending requests and handling responses depending on the models used. For instance, o1, o1-mini, o1-preview, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4o.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Examples of simple prompt engineering techniques to demonstrate how to construct queries for AI models.

## Getting Started

To use the notebook, you'll need to have Python installed along with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. <br/> `git clone https://github.com/rishabh-panda/applied-openai-llms.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory. <br/> `cd applied-openai-llms`
3. Install the required Python packages. <br/> `pip install jupyter notebook openai`
4. Open the `api_integration.ipynb` notebook.

## Prerequisites

You need to have an OpenAI API key to execute the API calls in the notebook. <br/>
Ensure that your API key is securely stored and not exposed in the notebook.
